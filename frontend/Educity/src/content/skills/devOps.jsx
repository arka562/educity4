      <h1>DevOps Study Guide</h1>

      <div className="study-subtitle">
        <p>
          A comprehensive guide to understanding DevOps practices, tools, and
          methodologies.
        </p>

      <div className="study-section">
        <h2>1. Introduction to DevOps</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition of DevOps:</strong> DevOps is a set of practices
          and cultural philosophies that aim to enhance collaboration between
          development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. It emphasizes automation
          of processes, continuous integration, and continuous delivery to
          improve software delivery speed, quality, and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Evolution of DevOps:</strong> Historically, there's been a
          divide between development and operations, leading to siloed
          departments. DevOps emerged to improve collaboration and accelerate
          software delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Benefits of Adopting DevOps:</strong> Faster time to market,
          improved collaboration, enhanced automation, and better software
          quality and stability.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="study-section">
        <h2>2. Core Concepts of DevOps</h2>
        <h3>Collaboration and Communication</h3>
        <p>
          Effective communication between development, operations, and other
          stakeholders is crucial. Practices like daily stand-ups and
          retrospectives are important for this.
        </p>

        <h3>Continuous Integration (CI)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> CI is the practice of regularly merging
          code changes into a central repository and automatically testing the
          code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Practices:</strong> Frequent code commits, automated
          testing, and immediate feedback on the state of the build.
        </p>

        <h3>Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)</h3>
        <p>
          CD ensures code is always in a deployable state. Continuous Deployment
          takes this a step further by automatically deploying passing code to
          production.
        </p>

        <h3>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> IaC is the practice of managing
          infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Tools:</strong> Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible.
        </p>

        <h3>Monitoring and Logging</h3>
        <p>
          Monitoring applications and infrastructure ensures proactive
          identification of issues.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="study-section">
        <h2>3. DevOps Culture and Practices</h2>
        <p>
          DevOps encourages a mindset of shared responsibility, where team
          members collaborate across the entire lifecycle of software
          development and operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agile methodologies align well with DevOps, enabling iterative
          development and quick feedback loops. Change management and feedback
          loops are key aspects of DevOps practices.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="study-section">
        <h2>4. DevOps Tools and Technologies</h2>
