        <h2>1. Introduction to Cybersecurity</h2>

        <h3>Definition and Importance</h3>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile
          devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious
          attacks. It is crucial in today's digital world, where cyber threats
          to sensitive data and systems can lead to severe financial losses,
          reputational damage, and legal implications.
        </p>

        <h3>The Evolution of Cybersecurity</h3>
        <div className="grid-container">

            <h4>Early Days</h4>
            <p>
              Initially, cybersecurity was focused primarily on physical
              security and electronic data protection.
            </p>
          </div>
